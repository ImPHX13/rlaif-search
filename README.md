# RL-Powered Search Engine Optimization

This repo uses Reinforcement Learning (PPO - Proximal Policy Optimization) to optimize search engine results. It integrates with Elasticsearch to dynamically improve search rankings based on real-time feedback.

## Implementation

The system uses a custom environment with Elasticsearch for document retrieval and a feedback agent for evaluating relevance. The agent is trained with PPO to learn optimal ranking strategies.
